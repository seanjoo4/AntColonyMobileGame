## Game Description:
**Manage Ants to GLORY!!!**
Guide your colony to reach the divine heights of globANT conquest! GROW your colony, LIFT food/resources, BITE those who threaten The Queen’s dominance, CLAIM territories, and most of importantly, WORK FOR THE QUEEN! This Pluto’s Playground’s production inspired by the popular Facebook group “A group where we all pretend to be ants in an ant colony” gives her beloved ants the opportunity to manage an ant colony on behalf of The Queen. 
**Dynamic events!**
BITE and you may gain GLORY (IngliourANT Basterds) or pay the price. Spiders,  snakes, rival ants and other insects all pose a threat to The Queen and her domain. It is up to you to guide the colony to victory!
LIFT and you may gain FOOD which in turn can be used to support an even larger ant colony. Beware though! You may tire out your noble ants if you LIFT too much!
**Become a DIVINE EMPIRE.**
Throughout your journey, you will face highs and lows. During these times, you will BITE heroically and write yourself into the history books. Other times, your own might turn on you. However, once you start getting experience, a once Tribal Village will soon UPGRADE into a Divine Empire. The Queen is counting on you. Even when it seems impossible, keep LIFTing. Your journey awaits...
